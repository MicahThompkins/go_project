player doesnt need to take in stone

remote player names come from what register returns

private variables/methods

unit tests 

test with remote player locally (make remote player)

Thrusday code walk feedback:
-clean up data structures
-when added a new player after cheating, can abstract that to same code for adding players in beginning of game
-for final presention, explain data structures first/early on
-dont need to track loses in league
-be careful about using objects as dict keys (compiler may change addresses)
